Fix triangulation scaling problems by referencing prior works

Continue work on replicating BICOS 

Measure performance speed of each component:
Loading config file
Loading images
Initial processing of images
Running correlation search
Checking each correlation against existing list
Triangulation
File creation

Minimize performance impact of each component to boost overall performance. 
-See if less input images can be used effectively

Continue work on ML development. This is done better at the office once a working model is created.
