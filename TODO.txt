Set up new environment and packages DONE

Fix reconstructor program handling of fundamental matrix DONE

Create presentation

Report rewrite 

Adjust filters for mice data images

Create new test script for mice data, previously used test script may be faulty. 

Add no-skew triangulation function to scripts and core scripts, integrate it into the recon program as an option box (Name: Increase Precision)

Add grid calibration functions to recon program

Create calibration function based on correlations, add to recon program

Create calibration function to find t-modifier value by comparing successive reconstructions with known good models, loaded as a pcf, xyz, or ply. Bonus: make this compatible with 3D model files such as step or mesh as well.  

Resume attempts to determine working process of legacy code triangulation

Resume work on machine learning aspect - need to resolve learning plateau and constant rate. Neither should be occuring.

Add documentation for the new code and functions
