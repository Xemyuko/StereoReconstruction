Set up new environment and packages DONE

Fix reconstructor program handling of fundamental matrix DONE

Create presentation

Report rewrite 


Add grid calibration functions to recon program

Create calibration function to find t-modifier value by comparing successive reconstructions with known good models, loaded as a pcf, xyz, or ply. Bonus: make this compatible with 3D model files such as step or mesh as well.  

Resume attempts to determine working process of legacy code triangulation

Resume work on machine learning aspect - need to resolve learning plateau and constant rate. Neither should be occuring.

Add documentation for the new code and functions


TODO Weekend:

Identify alternative rectification processes if the loop-zhang library does not work DONE
Resolved by using LMEDS instead of 8Point when finding the fundamental matrix

Analyze provided matlab reconstruction code and determine functionality
