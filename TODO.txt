Set up new environment and packages DONE

Fix reconstructor program handling of fundamental matrix DONE

Create presentation

Report rewrite 

Add highspeed mode for doing fast test reconstructions for data verification DONE

Add no-skew triangulation function to scripts and core scripts, integrate it into the recon program as an option box (Name: Increase Precision) DONE

Add grid calibration functions to recon program

Create calibration function to find t-modifier value by comparing successive reconstructions with known good models, loaded as a pcf, xyz, or ply. Bonus: make this compatible with 3D model files such as step or mesh as well.  

Resume attempts to determine working process of legacy code triangulation

Resume work on machine learning aspect - need to resolve learning plateau and constant rate. Neither should be occuring.

Add documentation for the new code and functions

Add more console printouts when program is running calculations DONE

Add function that creates a correlation mapping of an image-stack pair. 
-Rectify image stacks
-Run ncc on each pixel in each line, but instead of looking only for best matches, save the highest correlation for each pixel as intensity values.
-Leave filtered out pixels as intensity 0

Add function that creates a full data output of correlations
