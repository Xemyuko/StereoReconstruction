Chapter 1. Multiple View Geometry Introduction

Projective transformations to map objects onto the picture. Angles, distances, ratios of distance are not preserved. Straight lines are preserved. 
Ideal points at infinity are placed into Euclidean space to create projective space, so that two lines will always eventually meet in a point. 
A point in Euclidean 2-space is represented by (x,y). This can be extended to 3D space by adding a dimension at 1, (x,y,1). (2x,2y,2) and (x,y,1) represent the same point. Generalized, (kx,ky,k) are all the same point, getting the original point by dividing all coordinates by k. As such, the triple (x,y,0) does not correspond to any point. Dividing by the last coordinate results in dividing by 0. 

Homogeneity: 
In Euclidean geometry, all points are the same. When coordinates are added, the origin can be picked arbitrarily. This origin is only the origin of the particular coordinate system of reference that has been picked. Shifting and rotating the coordinate system to align with a different one is known as a Euclidean transform. Affine transformation is more general and adds another element, linear transformation (stretching) to the transform, which already consists of translation and rotation. The result of either transformation type is thta points at infinity remain at infinity. In projective geometry, points at infinity are not any different from other points. 

Projective transformation can be defined in projective space.
