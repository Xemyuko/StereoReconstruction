# StereoReconstruction
Stereo reconstruction of 3D objects with Python. Running Pyinstaller on the reconstructor.py script will result in an executable that implements normalized cross correlation based stereo reconstruction with a GUI.

Stereo rectification done with Loop-Zhang algorithm, implemented at: https://github.com/xmba15/uncalibrated_stereo_rectification
