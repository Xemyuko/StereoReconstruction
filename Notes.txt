Notes:

Problem 1: Sometimes, a windows memory access error occurs. Unknown cause, but not in python, therefore difficult to resolve. 
-Error is inconsistent, but happens reliably with certain data inputs. This error reliably happens on the last row to be analyzed. 

Windows fatal exception: access violation

-Error seems to occur in tqdm library. Technically, program can run without tqdm for progress tracking, but it is an important program feature. However, removing the tqdm call in the ncc_core results in the same error occurring.

Solutions: 
-Error can be prevented by changing offsets from default of 1 to 5 or 10.
-Error can also be prevented by using calculate F matrix setting instead of loading an existing one from a text file.

-However, none of these solutions address what happens when the error occurs unexpectedly, since the error crashes the program with no warnings  when it occurs. 

 
Problem 2: Integration of image capture program moving slowly due to missing libraries and code structure. 
-Need to create new configuration file with image capture settings stored
-alter existing code to reference configuration file
-Alter existing code to only connect to turntable when needed for rotation
-Get turntable and camera library installed


Problem 3:
Some inconsistencies reported in reconstruction processing times. Cause unknown, issue not yet replicated.

Problem 4: 
Using F Mat NCC calculation option is unusable, often results in 90 degree counter clockwise rotated images or warped nonsense.
Test cases: 5x test set 0: Angel-Rotated and warped, Boat- mostly black, Fruit-Rotated, Hand0-Rotated and warped, Hand1-heavily warped  2x test set 1: Bulb-Rotated, Schiller-Rotated

Solutions: 
Introduce rotational correction matrix to image stacks after applying fundamental matrix for stereo rectification
