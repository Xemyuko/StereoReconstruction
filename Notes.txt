Notes:

Problem 1: Sometimes, a windows memory access error occurs. Unknown cause, but not in python, therefore difficult to resolve. 
-Error is inconsistent, but happens reliably with certain data inputs. This error reliably happens on the last row to be analyzed. 

Windows fatal exception: access violation

-Error seems to occur in tqdm library. Technically, program can run without tqdm for progress tracking, but it is an important program feature. However, removing the tqdm call in the ncc_core results in the same error occurring.

Solutions: 
-Error can be prevented by changing offsets from default of 1 to 5 or 10.
-Error can also be prevented by using calculate F matrix setting instead of loading an existing one from a text file.

-However, none of these solutions address what happens when the error occurs unexpectedly, since the error crashes the program with no warnings  when it occurs. 

 
Problem 2: Integration of image capture program moving slowly due to missing libraries and code structure. 
-Need to create new configuration file with image capture settings stored
-alter existing code to reference configuration file
-Alter existing code to only connect to turntable when needed for rotation
-Get turntable and camera library installed


Problem 3:
Some inconsistencies reported in reconstruction processing times. Cause unknown, issue not yet replicated.
Normal condition: no distortion compensation, loading f matrix, 1 reconstruction per program operation
Testset1: 
Bulb: Normal Condition: 10:46
with second reconstruction:11:01
with third reconstruction:10:34
with 4th reconstruction:10:28
with 5th reconstruction:10:33
with distortion compensation:10:53 
with calculating f matrix + verify: 11:11

Schiller: Normal Condition: 11:12
with second reconstruction:11:15
with third reconstruction:11:15
with 4th reconstruction: 11:12
with 5th reconstruction: 11:16
with distortion compensation: 11:42
with calculating f matrix + verify: 11:20

No major differences in performance from repeated usage noted. Some differences seen in using different settings, but not really significant differences. 


Problem 4: 
Using F Mat NCC calculation option is unusable, often results in 90 degree counter clockwise rotated images or warped nonsense.
Test cases: 5x test set 0: Angel-Rotated and warped, Boat- mostly black, Fruit-Rotated, Hand0-Rotated and warped, Hand1-heavily warped  2x test set 1: Bulb-Rotated, Schiller-Rotated

Cause: unknown

Solutions: 
Introduce rotational correction matrix to image stacks after applying fundamental matrix for stereo rectification 


Problem 5:
Calculating F Mat for test set 0 data never works, regardless of settings. It returns nonsense except for the fruit object, which returns a rotated pair of images and the hand1 object, which works normally.  However, it works fine for test set 1 data.

Suspected cause: Insufficient data for calculating F matrix successfully due to small size of objects. test set 1 data has large proportion of object to background, while test set 0 except for the fruit object that is only slightly rotated instead of nonsense, has smaller objects.  

Steps to take: Identify number of points found in calculation process for test items. 
test set 1
Schiller: 189 points
Bulb: 212 points
test set 0
Angel: 2+1+2+3+1+3+3+1+3+2+1+1+2+1+2+2=30 points
Boat: 8+5+7 =20 points
Fruit: 9+7 = 16 points
Hand0: 57 points
Hand1: 19 points
Test set 1 has far more points found than test set 0. However, test set 0's hand1 object was successfully rectified with only 19 points, 10 times less than the number of points found in test set 1. 
Current threshold of points to find is 10. If 10 are not found in an image pairs, the program will continue to search image pairs until it finds a sufficient number. Raising this threshold may improve results.
